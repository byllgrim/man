# man
read man pages

This was just for fun.
Spawned after seeing a suckless thread about troff and man pages.
I was hoping it could serve as a parser of man pages on minimal systems, but
the fun was spent and the undertaking was greater than I can commit to atm.

# warning
There is no font formatting. No bold, no italics, no underscore etc.

I think the logic is poorly written and therefore it might possibly be futile
to try to extend this program to have more features.
Judge for yourself.

It only supports man macros and no mandoc/mdocml.

Only a miniscule portion of man macros are supported.

gzipped man pages are ignored.
